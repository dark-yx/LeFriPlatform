Overview

The Constitute Project site’s service methods enable developers to retrieve constitution and topic data. This document describes the services and how to use them.


Making a Service Request

To submit a service request send an HTTP GET request with a set of optional parameters. The parameters are included in the request URL as a set of name=value pairs. The service URL format is shown below.


https://www.constituteproject.org/service/<method_name>

[?<parameter_name>=<parameter_value>&<parameter_name>=<parameter_value>]


All service methods return JSON strings. Service methods are organised into categories as follows:


Requesting lists of objects
constitutions
topics
regions
Topic searches
constopicsearch
sectionstopicsearch
Free-text search
textsearch
Requests for constitution HTML
html

Constitution data, apart from constitution HTML, are returned in two forms: header data, and section data.  Methods returning header data are:


constitutions
constopicsearch
textsearch (with the cons_id parameter)

Methods returning constitution section data are:


topicsearch
sectionstopicsearch
textsearch
